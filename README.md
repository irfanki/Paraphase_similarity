# Paraphase_similarity
In this project we get the similarity of phases used in two similar sentences.

Embedding

1) Google News Vectors
2) Create word word embedding using MSR corpse.
You can use one of the above embedding provided in the notebook.


For Parsing 

I have used spacy to parse

1) Noun Phrases
2) Verb Phrases
3) Prepositional Phrases
However many more pharase can be using the nltk tree parsing as well.
